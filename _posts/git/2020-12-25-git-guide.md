#### What is git ?

Git is a open source distributed Version Control System(VCS) originally developed in 2005 by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) the creator of the linux kernel and is still being actively mantained.

#### Why use it ?

While working on a project git tracks the changes you make to files, thus keeping record of what has been done, so you can easily revert your project to some specific point or change should you ever need to. Git also makes collaboration easier, allowing changes by multiple people to all be merged into one source and maintaining projects efficiently. It does so by storing your changes in commits.
